          <h2>My Cadet Experience</h2>
          <p>I have been a dedicated member of my local <abbr title="Royal Air Force Air Cadets">RAFAC</abbr> 
              unit (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/388sqn/">388 Squadron</a>) since early 2021.
              I have worked hard during my time to learn as much as possible and develop myself and my skills.
              I have achieved several qualifications and been given leadership opportunities such as gaining 
              a rank, running activities on parade nights for cadets, and looking after cadets on camps. I 
              have done six week-long camps at various RAF bases, where I have gained insight into the 
              different roles that are available in the RAF and how they all fit together, whilst also networking
              with cadets from other units and having incredible experiences. I have also done several weekend 
              courses and activities, residential and non-residential, including: First Aid Courses, Adventure 
              Training (Rock-climbing, Hiking, and Paddlesports), Duke of Edinburgh Expeditions, Initial Weapons
              Training, JNCO course, Leadership courses, and more. I have also had the opportunity to have flown
              three times from different military airfields. My responsibilities currently include: being in 
              charge of running and maintaining my squadron's flight simulator, teaching parade nights, teaching
              drill, and general other duties. I have run and organised several events for cadets including 
              scavenger hunts and cyber activities that sometimes took weeks to plan and involved high amounts
              of teamwork and communication to execute successfully. I have also taken part in several 
              volunteering events such as: cleaning up parks after events, fundraising for local charities,
              and helping at the finish line of the Potter’s ‘arf Marathon. My time at cadets has taught me so
              much, leadership, teamwork, networking, discipline and organisation. In the next year, I hope to
              achieve: Silver DofE, National Advanced Cyber Specialist Course, First Aid at Work. I also plan
              to start the Qualified Aerospace Instructor Course and the Paddlesports Instructor Course. Cadets
              is something I am really passionate about and something that has been extremely beneficial to my
              development personally and professionally. </p>
